# Let's assign variables to represent a book you enjoy.

# Step 2 - Strings
book_name = "1984"
author = "George Orwell"
# book_name = "Dune"
# author = "Frank Herbert"

# Step 3 - Concatenation and f-strings
sentence1 = book_name + " is written by " + author + "."
sentence2 = f"Author, {author}, wrote the book {book_name}."

# Step 4 - Integers
publication_year = 1949
# publication_year = 1965

# Step 5 - Floats
book_price = 15.99
# book_price = 17.99

# Step 6 - Booleans
is_awesome = True
# is_awesome = True

# Step 7 - print and type functions
print(sentence1)  # Printing the first sentence.
print(sentence2)  # Printing the second sentence.
print("Publication year:", publication_year)
print("Book price:", book_price)
print("Is the book awesome?", is_awesome)

# Printing types
print(type(book_name))
print(type(author))
print(type(publication_year))
print(type(book_price))
